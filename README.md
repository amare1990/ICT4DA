## Description the project
This part of the Portfolio project implements local storage for the contact form input values.
The local storage implementation is done on a branch, "Added_Local-Storage" and merged to the main repository, Portfolio-Amare. Basically, local storage by browsers stores (key, value) pairs persistently. The browser helps users leave inserting their input values each time the user browses a site. This project helps users have their form values prefilled, done by javascript "load" event.  



## Built With

- Javascript
- Technologies used: VS code editor, git, github, github flow



## How can values be stored by browsers

** You have to use localStorage js object to store data. localStorage object has setItem() and getItem() methods to set the key value pairs and retrieve the values of the data stored. Use 'change' or 'input' js event to store when inputs are inserted first. use 'load' js event to retrieve stored data and prefill the form. **
